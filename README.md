# Kojima Name Generator

This is a small app based on the formula created by Brian David Gilbert from Polygon,
which allows us to create our Hideo Kojima name. You can see the formula in [this article](https://www.polygon.com/videos/2019/11/11/20959269/unraveled-kojima-name-generator-death-stranding) or watch the [original video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-3i6GBYvdw&feature=emb_title).

The app is available on https://pedrochaves.github.io/kojima-name-generator


## About Ownership

This project is not associated with Brian David Gilbert or Polygon by any means. It was created in my spare time just for fun.
I have no intention of using this to make money or steal the awesome and fun formula created by BDG.

## About Personal Data

Absolutely no personal data is being collected in this small application, I guarantee.
